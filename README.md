# NoSQL Social Network API

## Description
MongoDB is an increasingly popular database choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Since it is so popular it is important as developers that we fundamentally understand MongoDB and how it can be used build and structure the API. To emphasize this I have tried to create a Social Network API that users can share their thoughts, react to friends thoughts, and create a friends list.

## Installation
If you would like to try and run this application on your local machine first clone this code onto your machine.
After that navigate into the root directory of the cloned code and run `npm install` to get all the necessary dependencies. You can then run `node server.js` to spin up the backend / api. You will now be able to test the api routes on `http://localhost:3001/api/`.

## Usage
I will link a walkthrough video that demonstrates testing the API in Insomnia below:

## How to Contribute
Obviously this application is only the basic backend / api for a social network. Future development would definitely include implementing any front end at all.
